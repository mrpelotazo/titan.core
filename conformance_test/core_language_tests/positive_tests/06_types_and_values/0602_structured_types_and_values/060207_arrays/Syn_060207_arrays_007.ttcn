// The following requirement is tested:

// boundaries only). In such cases, the lower and upper values of the range 
// define the lower and upper index values. Such an array is corresponding to 
// a record of with a fixed length restriction computed as the difference 
// between upper and lower index bound plus 1 and indexing starting from the 
// lower bound of the array definition.
