// The following requirement is tested:
// Elements to be left out of the assignment shall be explicitly skipped in the list 
// by use of the not-used-symbol "-". Already initialized elements left without 
// a corresponding list member in a value list notation (i.e. at the end of a list) 
// are becoming uninitialized. In this way, a value with initialized elements can be 
// made empty by using the empty value list notation ("{}").
