// The following requirements are tested:
//System compatibility: a function or altstep referring to component type "A" in its system clause may be called
//or started in any context that has a system clause of type "B" or a test case with a runs on clause of type "B"
//and no system clause if all the port definitions of "A" have identical definitions in "B". If the type of the
//system is unknown in the calling function, this can lead to runtime errors if the component type "A" is not
//system-compatible with the type of the system the current test case was started on.
