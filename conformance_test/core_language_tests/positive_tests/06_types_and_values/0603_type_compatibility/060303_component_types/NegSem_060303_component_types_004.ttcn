// The following requirements are tested:
// Mtc compatibility: a function or altstep referring to component type "A" in its mtc clause may be called or
// started in any context that has a mtc clause of type "B" or a testcase with a runs on clause of type "B" if all the
// port definitions of "A" have identical definitions in "B". If the type of the mtc is unknown in the calling
// function, this can lead to runtime errors if the component type "A" is not mtc-compatible with the type of the
// running mtc.
