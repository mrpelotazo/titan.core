// The following requirements are tested:
// Direct and indirect cyclic definitions are not allowed with the exception of the 
// following cases:
// a) for recursive type definitions (see clause 6.2);
// b) function and altstep definitions (i.e. recursive function or altstep calls);
// c) cyclic import definitions, if the imported definitions only form allowed cyclic 
// definitions.
// The test is a copy of example 1 from the chapter 5.5
