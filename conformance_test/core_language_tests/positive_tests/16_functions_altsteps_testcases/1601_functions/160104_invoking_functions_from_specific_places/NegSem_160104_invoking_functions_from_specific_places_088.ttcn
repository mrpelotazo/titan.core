// The following requirement is tested:
// If value returning functions are called in receiving communication operations (in templates, template fields, 
// in-line templates, or as actual parameters), in guards or events of alt statements or altsteps (see clause 20.2), 
// or in initializations of altstep local definitions (see clause 16.2), the following operations shall not be 
// used in functions called in the cases specified above, in order to avoid side effects that cause changing the 
// state of the component or the actual snapshot and to prevent different results of subsequent evaluations 
// on an unchanged snapshot:
// a) All component operations, i.e. create, start (component), stop (component), kill, running (component), 
// alive, done and killed (see notes 1, 3, 4 and 6).
