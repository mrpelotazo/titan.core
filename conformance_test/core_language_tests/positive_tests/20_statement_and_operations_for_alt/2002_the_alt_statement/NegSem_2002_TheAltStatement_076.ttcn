// an inconsistency between the actual snapshot and the state of the component or introduce indeterminism 
// in the evaluation of the following alt branches or the re-evaluation of the same alt branch, the restrictions 
// imposed on the contents of functions called from special places (clause 16.1.4) shall apply to expressions
