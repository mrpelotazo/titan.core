// The following requirements are tested:
// If a variable referenced in the value, sender or @index clause is a lazy or fuzzy 
// variable, the expression assigned to this variable is equal to the result produced 
// by the receive operation i.e. later evaluation of the lazy or fuzzy variable does not 
// lead to repeated invocation of the receive operation.
