// The following requirements are tested:
// The value part of the reply operation consists of a signature reference with an associated 
// actual parameter list and (optional) return value. The signature may either be defined in 
// the form of a signature template or it may be defined in-line.

// Responses to one or more call operations may be sent to one, several or all peer entities 
// connected to the addressed port. This can be specified in the same manner as described in 
// clause 22.2.1. This means, the argument of the to clause of a reply operation is for unicast 
// responses the address of one receiving entity, for multicast responses a list of addresses 
// of a set of receivers and for broadcast responses the all component keywords.
