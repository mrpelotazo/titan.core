// The following requirements are tested:
// Exceptions to one or more call operations may be sent to one, several or all peer entities
// connected to the addressed port. This can be specified in the same manner as described in 
// clause 22.2.1. This means, the argument of the to clause of a raise operation is for 
// unicast exceptions the address of one receiving entity, for multicast exceptions a list of 
// addresses of a set of receivers and for broadcast exceptions the all component keywords.
