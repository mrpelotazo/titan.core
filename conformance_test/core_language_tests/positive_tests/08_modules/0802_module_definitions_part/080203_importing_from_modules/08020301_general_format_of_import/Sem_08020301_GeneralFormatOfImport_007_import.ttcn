// The following requirements are tested:
// Name clashes shall be resolved using qualified name(s) for the imported definition(s), 
// i.e. prefixing the imported definition by the identifier of the module in which it has 
// been defined; the prefix and the identifier shall be separated by a dot (".").
// In cases where there are no ambiguities the prefixing need not (but may) be present 
// when the imported definitions are used.
