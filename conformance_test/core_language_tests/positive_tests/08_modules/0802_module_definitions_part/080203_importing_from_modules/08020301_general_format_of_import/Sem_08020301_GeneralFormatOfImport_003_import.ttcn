// The following requirements are tested:
// Name clashes may occur due to import, e.g. import from different modules. Name clashes 
// shall be resolved using qualified name(s) for the imported definition(s), i.e. prefixing 
// the imported definition (which causes the name clash) by the identifier of the module in 
// which it has been defined; the prefix and the identifier shall be separated by a dot (".").
