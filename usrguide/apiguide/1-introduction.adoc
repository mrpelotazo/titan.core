*Bold* is used to represent graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, menus, menu items, dialog box options, fields and keywords, as well as menu commands. Bold is also used with ’+’ to represent key combinations. For example, *Ctrl+Click*

The '*/*' character is used to denote a menu and sub-menu sequence. For example, *File / Open*.

`Monospaced` font is used represent system elements such as command and parameter names, program names, path names, URLs, directory names and code examples.
